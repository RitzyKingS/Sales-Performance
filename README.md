## Code Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how we used SQL to extract monthly sales data:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', ship_date) AS sales_month,
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
    SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM 
    sales_data
GROUP BY 
    sales_month
ORDER BY 
    sales_month;
```

For advanced visualizations, LookML code like the following was used:

```yaml
view: sales {
  dimension: ship_date {
    sql: ${TABLE}.ship_date ;;
  }
  measure: total_sales {
    type: sum
    sql: ${TABLE}.sales ;;
  }
  measure: total_profit {
    type: sum
    sql: ${TABLE}.profit ;;
  }
}
```
